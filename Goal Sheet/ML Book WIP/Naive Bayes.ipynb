    "\n",
    "Naive Bayes is a supervised classification algorithm which belongs to the family of \"Probabilistic Classifiers\". As the name suggests, it is uses Bayes' theorem at its core. You can get a great intuitive sense about conditional probability from lectures of Prof John Tsitsiklis. \n",

Then someone gives you some new information, which changes your believes and thus changes the probabilities of your outcomes.\"`\n",
