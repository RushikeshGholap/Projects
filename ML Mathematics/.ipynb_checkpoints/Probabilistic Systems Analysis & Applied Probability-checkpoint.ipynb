This means, that now the new probability of P(B) becomes 1. But, B is divided into 2 propotions - P(B only) and P($A \\cap B$) in 2:1 propotion. So now, the Probability of A give that B has occured becomes the new Probability that A and B occured in our new sample space where B had occured or P(B) = 1.\n",
