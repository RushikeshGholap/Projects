    "resume = \"I am a Data Scientist with 7 years of experience, currently working as a lead (General manager, SME-1) at Reliance Industries, where I design, train and deploy ML models powering enterprise scale platforms and products. I currently lead a team of about 10 data scientists working closely with full stack developers, product teams and dev-ops to map out and productionalizing AI/ML architectures for cloud based applications related to employee management systems and services. Some of my projects include, geo-spatial route matching, distributed virtual assistants, recommendation engines, document semantic matching, anomaly detection on image data and natural language to querying a database. Previously I was heading the Strategy and Development of data powered products for a startup company called iPredictt Data Labs which I co-founded. My career in the data science domain started off in Mu-Sigma, a pure play analytics firm. I have worked cross domain including HR, Advertising, Retail and Entertainment industries. I have experience with supervised learning methods such as generalized linear models, decision trees, ensemble models (Stacknet, Xgboost, RF), support vector machines (SVM), probabilistic models, deep learning and unsupervised models such as K-means clustering, Gaussian mixture models, hierarchical DBScan for geo-spatial data, PCA, deep belief networks, RBMs and selforganizing maps. This includes applying NLP based models such as Seq2Seq models with attention, word embeddings (fasttext, word2vec, Glove), LSTM/GRUs, 1d convolutional networks. I enjoy exploring GANs, Deep dream networks, Reinforcement learning, Genetic algorithms, computer vision and network analysis. I have frequently worked with Django and Flask frameworks deployed via Ngrok or Docker on Amazon EC2, Azure VMs, and server-less deployment using Amazon Lambda (Zappa). Outside office I explore metaphysics, epistimology, theoritical physics, amateur mathematics and graphic designing. I have been a guitarist for over 10 years now.\""
