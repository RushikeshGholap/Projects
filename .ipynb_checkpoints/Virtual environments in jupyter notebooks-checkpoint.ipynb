    "\n",
    "A virtual environment is a Python environment such that the `Python interpreter`, `libraries` and `scripts` installed into it are isolated from those installed in other virtual environments, and (by default) any libraries installed in a “system” Python, i.e., one which is installed as part of your operating system.\n",
    "\n",
    "A virtual environment is a `directory tree` which contains Python executable files and other files which indicate that it is a virtual environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Common installation tools such as `setuptools` and `pip` work as expected with virtual environments. In other words, when a virtual environment is `active` (i.e., the virtual environment’s `Python interpreter is running`), they install Python packages into the virtual environment without needing to be told to do so explicitly.\n",
