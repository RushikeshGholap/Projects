abc,aaa,I was there at the place yesterday afternoon! And honestly i felt that it is one particular cafe but when you enter the place its huge i mean really huge and you will notice that there places inside bakery n ol! Differently managed and uniquely as well!,,,,
abc,aaa,i loved their concept of junction written by flowers! I ordered one kadhai paneer with butter roti!! :) and it was quite good portion wise and taste wise as well! Amazing experience will go there to try their another dishes! Thankyou team junction!,,,,
abc,aaa,Junction located near Huaz Khas is one of the most beautiful places that I've ever been to. The place is spread across 20000 sqft and literally blows you away with its aura as soon as you enter the place!,,,,
abc,aaa,"We tried Chicken Seekh Kebab, Garlic Bread and Momos. Chicken seekh kebabs were delicious and were served with mint chutney. Garlic bread was not that good and needs improvement. We also ordered for veg momos and they came hot with our beloved spicy chutney. Overall the place is pretty amazing to have a fun filled weekend with your friends.",,,,
abc,bbb,"This new property in Delhi is actually a junction of multiple cuisine trains. Spread across a huge area with different sections, this one boasts of a distinct sushi and dimsums bar, The Big Baker with a lovely assortment of desserts, a pizzeria, an outdoor seating area under the shade of trees (full marks for that) and indoor fine dine area. The Junction redefines the word multi-cuisine for you by serving multiple cuisines from all the courses. Here are a few of them that I recently tasted",,,,
abc,bbb,"First thing you will say the moment you enter here will be ""Whoa!! What a beautiful place"".. It's huge and it's beautiful at every corner.. First time when i saw pictures of this place i kinda doubted those pictures considering i haven't seen such a big restaurant around Hauz Khas area but then this one does exist in real.. It's almost like a posh farmhouse..†",,,,
abc,bbb,"Coming to the food part, it's just okay! i mean it's not like something you would drool on and it's neither something which you will complain about.. It's good nice food which one can enjoy on any fine day!†",,,,
efg,bbb,"The day i visited this place it was highly packed so i understand that servicing has to be slow, i mean these guys sure put their best efforts but then it becomes really difficult at times to control everything and maintain the calm...†",,,,
efg,bbb,"Overall i had good experience, i would love to visit this place some day soon to try more of their dishes and probably a better service..",,,,
efg,bbb,"The junction cafe is perfectly located on Aurobindo Marg, few minutes away from Green apark Metro Station.",,,,
efg,ccc,"It has a big and beautiful entrance with lawns on both side and they have placed a flower wall in centre which is first thing you notice after entering. This plave have amazing atmosphere with use of vibrant colourful combination and use of grass, sand and stones on different section to give it a natural touch.",,,,
efg,ccc,This place have spacious outdoor sitting with these amazing ambience which one can hardly find in cafe these days.,,,,
efg,ddd,"And on the other hand as the name says 'the junction', this place is actually a junction for different outlet put together which include different indoor sitting sections for bar, bakery and pizzeria etc.",,,,
efg,ddd,"One expect more when the place is amazingly beautiful and have a fresh ambience. But talking about food and service, both departments need improvement be it food which was good but not upto my expectations and service was too slow.",,,,
hij,ddd,"I tried virgin mojito, blue lagoon, veg dimsum and garlic bread, i liked blue lagoon and dimsum. And in main course dal makhni and paneer with breads.",,,,
hij,ddd,Overall one can try mocktails and dimsum. And all in all food and service need improvement to match up the ambience of that place.,,,,
hij,eee,"† If you too bored of hitting a food court at any and every mall, here's a good deal of multiple outlets all put together under one roof yet keeping the theme of a standalone restaurant intact.",,,,
hij,eee,"The Junction is an all you need kind of a food brand that encompasses all things you'd need to make up for a memorable evening. With a choice of having 5-6 different seating areas to choose from, there's something for every occasion and mood. From Wine Cellars to a Pizzeria and even a bakery; you can pick one or all.",,,,
hij,eee,Me and my guy ended up here last evening to basically unwind a little after a really hectic schedule at work for an entire month. So we thought of going to a place which can fulfill our distinct tastebuds--me being a dessert junkie and he prefers nuce drinks for all occasions (and by drinks I mean soft and other fruity concotions) !,,,,
hij,fff,"For starters, we ate Dahi Ke Kebabs--which were soft, gooey and melt in the mouth with a fine crisp deep fried outer layer making it a good combo of soft and hard, Dimsums, and Garlic Breadsticks--I'd like to call the garlic bread here as the new age garlic bread simply cos of its style and way of presentation. Mounted atop of small burger like buns with the garlic and butter filled on top of it with shredded cheese--it is a must try!",,,,
abc,aaa,"We really ordered a hell lot of drinks for accompaniment--from Bloody Mary to Oreo Choc Shake and Virgin Mojito to Lemon Ice Tea and Purple Blaze and Blue Lagoon--we had them all. All taste fine, no complaints.",,,,
abc,aaa,"The gripe came in the form od the main course though--The Shepherd's dish was yum but the usual Indian affair we ate was nothing great. Imagine not having the Dal Makhani being cooked well, like how hard is it to cook this simple yet beauty of a Dal?",,,,
abc,aaa,"The Fish Curry I didn't try but heard was decent amongst the Mutter Mushroom, Paneer Lababdar and other desi dishes put on a buffet.",,,,
abc,aaa,"The dessert for the day was Moong Dal Halwa which again left is disappointed. Not hot, not sweet enough and definitely lacking the ghee element, it was rather hard and tasteless.",,,,
abc,bbb,Determined we went into The Bakery and had some sinful Double White and Brown Chocolate Cookies packed for ourselves which we had this morning in breakfast--and we are glad we bought them!,,,,
abc,bbb,"The ambience is great. We went there at night, but I guess the views would be even better during the day time. The kebabs as starters were excellent. The main course was alright and the desserts were excellent. Not as pricey as it may feel.",,,,
abc,bbb,Where do I start!! Well I am sure I will run out of words hence I will let the photograph do the talking.,,,,
efg,bbb,Eating in silver cutlery will surly make you feel your in Nizam era and the quality of food is just amazing.,,,,
efg,bbb,Chose this place to celebrate our first marriage anniversary and I couldn't thank my stars for picking up this Resturant.,,,,
efg,bbb,Staff well trained and polite.. need more knowledge of the food being served.,,,,
efg,ccc,Drinks awesomely done,,,,
efg,ccc,Food super.Awesome..,,,,
efg,ddd,Overall experience authentic and thrilling,,,,
efg,ddd,PS some cutlery needs immediate attention,,,,
hij,ddd,This is one of the finest restaurants in hyderabad.,,,,
hij,ddd,I had chicken soup first and It was one of the finest soup I ever had.,,,,
hij,eee,"Though starters were just good, The 6 curries I got along with the butter naan made me lose my heart over the food. More over, they were made of pure ghee. A must place that everyone should visit atleast once.",,,,
hij,eee,"This Jewel was on my radar since long, and finally visited for dinner over a weekend.",,,,
hij,eee,"Beautiful ambiance - royal, lavish, soothing. A perfect setting for luxury fine dining.",,,,
hij,fff,"Restaurant is on eleventh floor of a 'minar' (tower) at Golkonda resorts. The resort itself is very nicely maintained, beautiful, calm and seems a good place for a getaway.",,,,
klm,ggg,Coming back to the restaurant experience - though it faired well in terms of ambiance and service - food was disappointing.,,,,
klm,ggg,We opted vegetarian set menu.,,,,
klm,ggg,Soup was good.,,,,
klm,ggg,"Starters - liked the corn tikki, but paneer tikka was average and Hyderabadi seekh kebab was very dry.",,,,
klm,ggg,Mains - we were served 5 diff curries - and none of them qualified to be even called 'good'.,,,,
klm,ggg,Breads - only two kinds of breads.,,,,
klm,ggg,Salad - plain green salad served as if we were eating at a roadside eatery.,,,,
klm,ggg,Subs Biryani - had no flavour or veggies!,,,,
klm,hhh,Desserts - they were the only saviours / show stoppers. Loved the anokhi kheer. Double ka meetha was also nice.,,,,
klm,hhh,May be visit for the experience (but not if looking to satisfy the taste buds).,,,,
klm,hhh,"It was a mixed experience of visiting this place. The place surpasses your expectations by every stretch of the imagination in terms of ambience and overall feel. However, when it comes to food there is nothing which inches beyond ordinary. In fact some of the items don't even meet expectations. The only sigh of relief was onion kheer which is undoubtedly unique and satisfies your taste buds to the core.",,,,
klm,hhh,I visited jewel of Nizam with my team for a relaxed lunch. We decided to order from the menu ourselves Instead of taking the usual set menu.,,,,
klm,hhh,Disclaimer: Cost here is very high,,,,
klm,iii,"Starting with starters. Non vegetarian starters were fantastic. The nisha jheenga had huge pieces of prawn and we're absolutely delicious. Theor signature, pathar ghosht, was soft and flavourful meat. Kalimirch chicken tikka was my favourite, the chicken was juicy and delicious.",,,,
klm,iii,"Vegetarian starters were poor tasting, besides the paneer tikka I didn't particularly enjoy any other item on the veg platter.",,,,
klm,iii,"Coming to maincourse, food was great for both veg and non veg diners. My recommendation is the rogan Josh and murgh mazedar with paneer stuffed kulcha or butter naan. The mutton biryani was excellent as well, not too spicy and extremely flavourful and rich in ghee with an amazing aroma.",,,,
klm,iii,They have an interesting list of drinks as well. I suggest the guava lassi or rose thandai. Both are,,,,
nop,iii,"Last but not the least, the desserts were the stars of the show. The angoori kheer, mataka kulfi were mind blowing and kaddu Ka halwa was amazing as well. I would come again, Just for this dessert.",,,,
nop,jjj,"One of the most lavishly arranged restaurants you'll ever find in the city. Themed with the rich and royal nawabi style,you will fall in love with the place right from the entrance. We had a dinner buffet. Everything was so very well arranged. It started out with shorba,that tasted very good. And then came the khulchas with 9 different starters. Out of them the best one is undoubtedly the gosht curry in which the pieces were so tender!! And then the king of the main course arrived just in time!! Biryani!!! The biryani here is soo good that one would fall in love with it in the very first sight,forget about tasting the biryani!! I would definitely visit this place once again just for the buffet and also the lavishly designed interiors that make you go back to an era of nizams indeed!!",,,,
nop,jjj,The best place I have been to if you consider the ambience and the service they offer. The staff here treat you like a Nizam.,,,,
nop,jjj,Quality of food is amazing and quantity is more than you expect. Ambience is breathtaking. You need to make a prior reservation and if you are going for late night dinner please have your own transport or leave by 11 as getting a cab is tough.,,,,
nop,jjj,There onion kheer is mouth watering and btw this place is not that expensive.,,,,
nop,jjj,"Experience Royalty! Reservation is a must for this place, you might not be as lucky as me to find a table ;) and might have to go back all the way without experiencing this beautiful place.",,,,
nop,jjj,"It is away from the hustle bustle of the city next to the Golkonda resorts. I went for dinner so couldn't see much as it was dark. The moment you enter u feel royal, from table setting to the cutlery everything oozes royalness. Tried the Amrud lassi which was awesome right amount of consistency and sweetness. Next was main course Nizam subz handi with butter roti. My colleague has kebabs, going by the verdict they were great. Felling lucky to have visited this place.",,,,
nop,jjj,Me and my friend we went to the buffet it was very huge buffet . U can get everything in this place sushi dimsum etc the menu of the buffet is too large . We started from soup it was very good authentic taste . I tryed everything which was available there and it was amazing except the sushi (veg sushi it smelled and tasted like fish i wont recommend anyone to try sushi ) apart from that everything was amazing . The dessert counter was very good they were fresh and full of flavors . The buffet started at 12.30 ended at 3pm the time was not sufficient for me to have everything because it was very huge buffet menu and i forgot to take picture because of it next time when i go there i will upload it . This place is value for money i will recommend it this place.,,,,
nop,jjj,"A very good place with wide range of variety for buffet.One cannot say that I didn't find this food.Biriyani,pasta,soup, sushi and what not.Huge food variety and taste was it was too good.They have taken care of the quality as well.Loved the way they have decorated their food items.A must go place if you are in Hyderabad.",,,,
nop,jjj,"I had sea food soup and it was very well cooked and tasty.Other than that Biriyani,mutton,chicken all was tasty.Tasted sushi for the first time and it was good as well.For desserts they serve whatever you have on your list.The best place ever I have been for buffet.",,,,
nop,kkk,"I never thought I'd eat here in this lifetime. Definitely way over my budget no matter how much I make, because I believe in deriving value from the money I spend. Food, though amazing, is not worth spending so much over, for me at least.",,,,
qrs,kkk,"But then again, to each his own.",,,,
qrs,kkk,I had the pleasure of experiencing the buffet at this wonderful restaurant due to a corporate lunch party and I have only one word to describe it. GRAND.,,,,
qrs,kkk,"The spread was really endless and I'm pretty sure I missed quite a bit of it because there was food everywhere! Starters were above average but not great. The main course was tasty. But the highlight, like in every buffet for me, the deal sealer... The dessert section!",,,,
qrs,kkk,"And it absolutely did not fail to impress. This was probably the only time I came out of that section, my plate full, but still missing so many various kinds of desserts. I wish I could have had them all but they were exquisite.",,,,
qrs,kkk,My sweet tooth is ecstatic.,,,,
qrs,kkk,A definite recommendation for someone who wants to celebrate. Westin is the place that's perfect for an occasion.,,,,
